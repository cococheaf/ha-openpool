# Changelog

## 1.1.7

- Keep heat-pump control untouched during short restart pulses and add a short
  pump-restore confirmation window after each pulse.
- Avoid the false `Heizung AUS` command-log entry that could happen while Home
  Assistant had not yet reported the pump as on again after a pulse.

## 1.1.6

- Read the available heat-pump start operating modes from the configured Home
  Assistant `select` entity instead of relying on a fixed UI list.
- Keep the previous Heat/Cool/Auto/Boost Heat/Silent Heat values as a fallback
  while Home Assistant has not yet provided selector options.
- Add translated add-on option labels and documentation for the heat-pump
  operating mode selector.

## 1.1.5

- Add `entities.heater_operation_mode` for a Home Assistant `select` entity that
  controls the heat pump operating mode.
- Add a persisted heat-pump start mode selector to the heating controls with
  `Auto` as default and options for Heat, Cool, Auto, Boost Heat and Silent Heat.
- Apply the selected operating mode when OpenPool starts the heat pump.

## 1.1.4

- Change Dauerbetrieb restart handling from fixed daily restart pulses to a
  dedicated 12-hour runtime restart.
- Show the next Dauerbetrieb restart as `12h-Restart` in the activity card
  instead of showing the configured `Pulse 1` schedule.

## 1.1.3

- Add a large-desktop layout profile that uses more available screen width and
  scales dashboard spacing, cards, buttons and sensor typography on wide desktop
  screens only.

## 1.1.2

- Remove the internal sensor-card scroll area and let the dashboard grid size the
  task history and sensor cards together.
- Enlarge the task history card and its text so the tablet layout has enough
  natural height for the full sensor list.

  height.

  first stable release.
